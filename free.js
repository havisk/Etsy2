Anti Aging and Intense Hydration w\/ Coconut Water & Moringa.","description":"** This blend is the replacement for my previous &quot;Everlasting&quot; Lotion&quot; **\n\n\nMore additions of my Brand New, All Natural Line &quot;Omega-7 Heaven&quot; Superfruit & Superfood Anti Aging, Intense Skin Hydrating, Face Smoothie Products! \n\n((( Also listed is this version, is the Superfruit Smoothie Body Lotion!)))\n\n\nThis blend is highly concentrated, containing the &#39;Best of the Best&#39; of Pure Organic Herbs, Superfoods, Superfruits, PURE Coconut Water, and a rich 4% concentration of Pure Vitamin B3 for INTENSE Skin Hydration!! \n\n\nThis  is a ONE OF A KIND, Exceptional Product that is Packing a POWERFUL Electrolyte, Antioxidant, and Superfruit Punch!!\n\n\nI had a 58 year old woman tester try this out, and she first applied it to the back of one of her hands, for comparison. Then she told me that it wasn&#39;t ten minutes later when she felt & noticed a definite difference in the hydration, plumpness, and overall healthy glow to her skin; all without being greasy at all, and exceptionally smooth & soft to the touch!\n\n\nThis All Natural Face Lotion is satiny smooth and light, non comedogenic (won&#39;t clog pores) and will soak deep into your layers, providing dry, thirsty skin with optimum hydration; absorbing this lotions many vitamins & minerals! It will arrive with a treatment pump that easily dispenses the lotion.\n\n\nPure Coconut Water is fabulous for all skin types, and provides an incredible amount of electrolytes to hydrate, soften and smooth your skin; achieving that young, beautiful natural glow!\nCoconut water is considered the PUREST liquid, second only to water itself! \n\n\nThere have been numerous studies done of the effects of Coconut Water for the body & skin, it is the incredible nutrients in this water that is what feed the coconut through its entire young (green) life, and is naturally filtered by its outer layer fibers. It is incrediby rich in antioxidants & cytokinins, which can also promote numerous age defying benefits!\n\n\nThis Omega-7 & Superfruit Anti Aging Smoothie Lotion is also abundantly rich in Certified Organic Moringa Oleifera Oil, 4% Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide), as well as the rare and incredibly crucial  Omega-7 carriers; Organic Seabuckthorn Fruit & Seed Oils, and Macadamia Nut Oil!\n\n\nEveryone has heard of the highly beneficial Omega Fatty Acids 3, 6 & 9...but rarely come across the AMAZING Omega 7, also known as Palmitoleic acid, and it has been a marvelous skin care secret of the Ancient Greece for literally thousands of years! \n\n\nOmega 7&#39;s limited availablility is mainly due to the fact that ONLY 3 sources are known to possess it; these are Seabuckthorn (Highest naturally occuring source at almost 50% Palmitoleic acid), Macadamia Nut (Mid Level carrier, containing up to almost 18%), and lastly, Wild Cold Water Fish; primarily Salmon.\n\n\n**Seabuckthorn is the ONLY known source to supply ALL FOUR Fatty Acids; Omega&#39;s 3, 6, 7 & 9!\n\n\nWhy are Omega 7&#39;s so outstanding, and critical (as researchers call it) to the body; Skin, Hair, Nails..all tissue?? This is because Palmitoleic acid (Omega 7&#39;s main source) has been known to:\n\n(1) be a strong tissue regenerator, \n(2) be an incredibly strong antioxidant with powerful anti aging benefits, \n(3) be an incredible scavenger of free radicals, having the ability to control them.\n(4) are the predominant fatty acid in epithelial cell membranes, \n(5) and are thought to protect cell membranes from oxidative stress.\n\n\nSeabuckthorn sourced Omega 7 fatty acids are also quite rich in phytosterols and phytonutrients, which nourish, soothe and deeply moisturize the skin. All of these benefits, just from the Omega-7 Fatty Acids, work seamlessly together to build a healthy collagen matrix within the skins tissue.\n\n\nResearched & Clinically Studied Benefits of Topically Applied Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide), may:\n\n(1) Assist with Acne related issues\n(2) Reduce Skin Redness & Inflammation\n(3) Increase Natural Ceramide Levels, which help prevent water loss in skin\n(4) Improve Skin Elasticity\n(5) Age Defying Effects to naturally reduce appearance of lines & wrinkles\n(6) Help control overactive sebum (oily skin) levels\n(7) Help Increase natural hyaluronic acid production within the skin\n(8) Help fight UVA & UVB ray absorption\n(9) Brighten Hyperpigmented skin tones\n(10) Help repair sun damage\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\n...AND THATS ONLY THE HALF OF IT!!\n\nThose mentioned above are just SOME of the outstanding, pure, organic, rich ingredients in this custom blended formula of mine!\n\n\nHere is JUST SOME of the other Natural ingredients: \n\nWildcrafted Cupuacu Butter, Murumuru Butter, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Organic Argan Oil, Blackberry Seed Oil, Blueberry Seed Oil, Wildcrafted Organic Tamanu (Foraha) Oil, Organic Hand Harvested & Dried Bamboo Leaf (highest natural source or organic silica; which helps to promote strong healthy skin, hair & nails), Wildcrafted Camu Camu Extract (Natures highest known, PURE Vitamin C Source - NO Synthetic Ascorbic Acid version here!!), Resveratrol, Wildcrafted Yerba Mate, Lychee Fruit Extract, Organic Goji Berry Fruit Extract, Organic African Rooibos, Organic Pomegranate Fruit Extract, Acai Berry Extract, Green Tea, Therapeutic Grade Pure Essential Oils of Organic Helichrysum Italicum, Rosewood, Neroli...AND MORE!!! \n\n\nThis Custom blend is absolutely packed to the gills with Omega-7&#39;s, Vitamins, Minerals, Superfood & Superfruit Goodness; Unmatchable Anywhere Else, and for a Fraction of the price!\n\n\n* * * I protect my formulations, so if you&#39;d like the complete ingedient list, please convo me and I&#39;ll be happy to email it to you.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* * * THIS PRODUCT IS:\n\n- All Natural\n- Non Comedogenic (Won&#39;t clog pores)\n- Organic\n- Vegan Friendly\n- Gluten Free\n- Formaldehyde Free\n- Chemical Free\n- Synthetic Free\n- Chemical Preservative Free\n- Phenoxyethanol Free\n- Soy Free\n- Dairy Free\n- Paraben Free\n- Naturally Preserved with Eco Certified, Plant Based Extracts (costs 8x more than chemical\/synthetic preservatives many use, but this natural premium blend is MUCH better for your skin & your health!)\n- No Fillers; it is HIGHLY Concentrated!\n...just All Natural, Beautifying Skin Care!\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE * * * \n\nTHIS IS NOT A SCENTABLE PRODUCT!

The more Jeep Waves the Better!\n\nHow long will it take to receive my order?\nDecals are usually shipped within 2 days of order. Please allow approximately 1 week to receive your order.\n\nHow do I apply my decal?\n1. Apply to the outside of a window or smooth painted surface. It&#39;s very important to clean window or surface with rubbing alcohol not windex. Do not apply in direct sunlight, apply in the shade. 2. Peel off the white paper backing and apply the sticky part to the glass or surface. Applying from one side to the other will reduce air bubbles. Rub or squeegee on with a plastic squeegee. ( I.D. Cards work too) 3. Now, Just peel off the remaining plastic or paper application tape very slowly at a sharp angle away from the decal. If the decal starts to come up as well rub it again or squeegee more then try again patiently.","creation_tsz":1444272460,"ending_tsz":1454903260,"original_creation_tsz":1398051798,"last_modified_tsz":1444272460,"price":"6.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":305,"tags":["Jeep Wave","Jeep Wrangler","Wrangler","Jeep","Jeep Wave Decal","STJW","Jeep Decal","Wrangler Decal","Wave","Wave Decal","Jeep Decals","Rubicon Decal"],"category_path":["Everything Else"],"category_path_ids":[68887416],"materials":["Vinyl"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":1,"state_tsz":1442840301,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/186881547\/jeep-wave-decal-high-quality-vinyl?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":16451,"num_favorers":994,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1895,"taxonomy_path":["Electronics & Accessories","Car Parts & Accessories","Car Accessories"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":592098133,"hex_code":"6F4035","red":111,"green":64,"blue":53,"hue":11,"saturation":52,"brightness":43,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1398051798,"listing_id":186881547,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/9420171\/il_75x75.592098133_c23t.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/9420171\/il_170x135.592098133_c23t.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/9420171\/il_570xN.592098133_c23t.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/9420171\/il_fullxfull.592098133_c23t.jpg","full_height":480,"full_width":375},{"listing_image_id":807287498,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1437842015,"listing_id":186881547,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/074\/0\/9420171\/il_75x75.807287498_ms2c.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/074\/0\/9420171\/il_170x135.807287498_ms2c.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/074\/0\/9420171\/il_570xN.807287498_ms2c.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/074\/0\/9420171\/il_fullxfull.807287498_ms2c.jpg","full_height":1064,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":807068713,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1437842015,"listing_id":186881547,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/9420171\/il_75x75.807068713_6dwa.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/9420171\/il_170x135.807068713_6dwa.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/9420171\/il_570xN.807068713_6dwa.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/9420171\/il_fullxfull.807068713_6dwa.jpg","full_height":1417,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":807074965,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1437842015,"listing_id":186881547,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/071\/1\/9420171\/il_75x75.807074965_84k6.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/071\/1\/9420171\/il_170x135.807074965_84k6.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/071\/1\/9420171\/il_570xN.807074965_84k6.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/071\/1\/9420171\/il_fullxfull.807074965_84k6.jpg","full_height":1462,"full_width":1461},{"listing_image_id":807069475,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1437842015,"listing_id":186881547,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/070\/0\/9420171\/il_75x75.807069475_mkcd.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/070\/0\/9420171\/il_170x135.807069475_mkcd.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/070\/0\/9420171\/il_570xN.807069475_mkcd.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/070\/0\/9420171\/il_fullxfull.807069475_mkcd.jpg","full_height":599,"full_width":799}],"Shop":{"shop_id":9420171,"shop_name":"JeepWaveDecals","user_id":47224491,"creation_tsz":1398052380,"title":"Support the Jeep Wave with our Jeep Wave Decals!","announcement":"We are a group with the sole purpose of continuing the tradition of The Jeep Wave.

If they feel gritty or sandy, they are real pearls. If they feel smooth, they are not real.\r\nB, Tooth Test\r\nRub the pearls lightly along the biting edge of your upper front teeth. If they feel gritty or sandy, they are real pearls. If they feel smooth, they are probably imitations.\r\nC, Flaw Test\r\nExamine the pearls for flaws. If they appear flawless and unnatural perfection, they might be imitation.

As I LOVE what I do, I also LOVE my beautiful family and spending time with them. That being said... if you make a purchase or send me a message after 6pm (my time), then I will reply to you or your purchase will be emailed over the next day.  Sunday mornings are set aside for church, so please allow time for me to return from Church to send them on Sundays.  All purchases will be emailed within 24 hours unless otherwise notified.  I really work hard to get purchases emailed in a timely manner.  We are all human, have busy lives and things come up... so please try to understand if I can&#39;t send your purchase right away.  The formats I send are: DST, EXP, HUS, JEF, PES, SEW, VIP, VP3 or XXX.  I can not convert to ART.  If no format is noted at your time of check out, I will automatically send format PES.  If you need a different format, just email me and let me know.  I am happy to send the correct format over.  Custom Designs have become a huge part of what I do, so please give me 2-3 weeks to get them finished.  Font sets may take longer... Sometimes the designs are sent much quicker than that, but I do get backed up at times.  Please know that I do EXCLUSIVE designs on LOGOS ONLY.  Please send me a convo for Logo fees.  A picture of your logo will be needed in order for me to create it and also written permission from the owner of the artwork to re-create their logo into an embroidery format.  Prices for logos will vary depending on the complexity of the logo. Designs that are not logos WILL NOT be exclusive.  All other designs (non-logos) created WILL be posted for re-sale on my site.  It&#39;s just ME. :) Refunds will be considered based on the situation.  There are no refunds or exchanges once the files have been emailed.  There is NO sharing, copying, or re-selling of my work.  I work very hard to create these designs for you to enjoy.  Please respect my hard work as I will continue to create many more for you to enjoy.  You may sell an item with my design on it (t-shirts, onesies, bibs, towels, etc...) ~ Just not sell the actual design itself.  The Free Font or Design for the Buy 2 Get 1 Free Fonts or Designs Special must be of equal or lesser value.  Do NOT purchase the free font.  You must list it in the notes at check out.  You will NOT get a refund or credit for purchasing the free fonts.  If you wish to cancel an order that has not been emailed to you yet, or hasn&#39;t been downloaded then I am happy to refund your purchase. All Instant Download files are your responsibility to download.  If there is a format that is not a choice for instant download, you must convo me your format or list it in the notes at check out.  If you don&#39;t then I will assume you will download one of the formats available for instant download.  I have the right to refuse a sale to anyone.\r\n\r\nI enjoy working with everyone and I hope you enjoy my designs as much as I enjoy watching you print them out. :)\r\n\r\nHappy Stitching!\r\nJamie Aldridge","policy_shipping":"All fonts and designs will be emailed to your email address that is provided through Etsy within 24 hours of purchase.

They began wearing them everywhere they went, including bed. As we were out, other people became interested and overnight it became Pip and Bean. \r\nMy goal is to provide other children with well-made, inexpensive dress up clothes so that every kid can grow up with imagination.\r\n\r\nAbout our capes: Our capes are premium quality satin measuring 29 inches in length\r\nEach cape is two panels - twice the strength and twice the options allowing you to pick one or two colors. The capes close with a velcro strip for safety. Our goal is to make a cape that fits your little ones interests or personality. We Love custom orders and new emblem ideas.

This wall art measures 24 x 54 inches this is a 3PC painting , It is a textured painting. featuring shades of white ,gray and black .Silhoutte\n\n\n\n\nThis is an original piece, I would consider each one of my paintings to be one of a kind . Since it is painted by me each piece I create is different and unique in its own way .I am proud to say all my paintings are Made in America, in my studio in New York each one is hand signed by me the artist.\n\nThey are painted on high quality 3\/4 inch stretched canvas with a Gallery wrapped edge. What is STRETCHED canvas ? Stretched canvas means the canvas has been stretched and secured on a wooden frame. GALLERY WRAPPED simply means the canvas has been secured and stapled on the back to give the canvas a nice finished edge.This is a great thing since you will not have to buy a frame for your painting, it can be hung up straight from the box.\n\nWhat will your piece look like when you take it from the box. It will be carefully wrapped in bubble wrap to ensure its safe arrival . Did I mention that all of my pieces are fully insured so there are no shipping worries.OK back to the painting, once you remove the bubble wrap,first thing you will notice is the beautiful protective finish. I want your piece to last for years and years, it also makes it easy to dust. If you are looking for texture this piece has it . It is very dramatic the texture almost pops off the canvas making this piece the focal point of any room . It will create interest from every angle. Once your painting is displayed home you will notice people will be drawn to it, they will want to touch it .Guess what its OK let them because your painting is as durable as it is beautiful . Now take a look to the bottom right hand corner here you will will see my signature. .On occasion a piece may only be signed on the back . You wonder why ? I do this because I like to leave my clients options.the versatility of hanging your piece vertical or horizontal .This way it can be easily displayed in different areas of your home.\n\nAlright now that you took your treasure from the box what do you do with it ? Its simple, nothing special is needed, just a couple little picture hangers and you are all set.Generally a painting can be hung up within 5 minutes. You might ask why I don&#39;t use wire on my pieces ,its plain and simple , over the years I have seen those little wires and hooks create damage.Damage that I&#39;m not willing to risk your painting. It also will leave you that hanging versatility I mentioned above.\n\nI think I have covered everything ,but in case I didn&#39;t I would love to hear from you. If you have any questions send them along, want to share your space, ask for a suggestion, I would be happy to see your room. Send me a photo I am always glad to help.This is my favorite part I&#39;m going to ask a favor of you, if you would like to you to share a photo with me, of the painting hanging in your beautiful home. I would love to see it .This is one of my biggest enjoyments !! .\n\nTITLE : Timeless\nSIZE : 24&quot; x 54&quot;\nEach panel Measures : 24&quot; X 18 &quot;\nMEDIUM : Acrylic & Oil\nSIGNED and DATED on the FRONT\nYEAR CREATED 2015","creation_tsz":1444272323,"ending_tsz":1454903123,"original_creation_tsz":1416328595,"last_modified_tsz":1444272323,"price":"299.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["art","painting","original painting","abstract painting","acrylic painting","large wall art","large painting","large abstract","abstract art","oil painting","canvas painting","red","huge painting"],"category_path":["Art","Painting"],"category_path_ids":[68887312,68890908],"materials":["canvas","paint"],"shop_section_id":17138700,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1441577996,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/211682502\/large-abstract-paintings-24-x-54-art-by?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":2635,"num_favorers":554,"shipping_template_id":5247502098,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":106,"taxonomy_path":["Art & Collectibles","Painting","Acrylic"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":837903781,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1442942634,"listing_id":211682502,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/5693606\/il_75x75.837903781_kngm.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/5693606\/il_170x135.837903781_kngm.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/5693606\/il_570xN.837903781_kngm.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/5693606\/il_fullxfull.837903781_kngm.jpg","full_height":1029,"full_width":1329},{"listing_image_id":838127180,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1442942634,"listing_id":211682502,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/5693606\/il_75x75.838127180_ph2y.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/5693606\/il_170x135.838127180_ph2y.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/5693606\/il_570xN.838127180_ph2y.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/5693606\/il_fullxfull.838127180_ph2y.jpg","full_height":528,"full_width":1227},{"listing_image_id":837903889,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1442942634,"listing_id":211682502,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/5693606\/il_75x75.837903889_9can.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/5693606\/il_170x135.837903889_9can.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/5693606\/il_570xN.837903889_9can.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/5693606\/il_fullxfull.837903889_9can.jpg","full_height":1029,"full_width":1329}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5693606,"shop_name":"JMJARTSTUDIO","user_id":8355345,"creation_tsz":1256758232,"title":"Original New York Art","announcement":" My original abstract braille paintings  have been featured on the TODAY Show.
